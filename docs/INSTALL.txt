Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ''vindula.services'' to the list of eggs to
   install ::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        vindula.services

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.

Check the box next to ''vindula.services'' and click the 'Activate' button.

Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
if you installed it from the quick installer.

Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
in order to see the effects of the product installation.
